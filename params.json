I work on a variety of coding projects, mentor newer developers, and provide oncall support as needed.\r\n\r\nThis is my most recent coworker, Meemo. He works odd hours and has never missed a day. You guys would love him too!\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n   <img \r\n      src=\"https://github.com/codemonkey3045/codemonkey3045.github.io/blob/master/meemo2.png?raw=true\"\r\n      alt=\"Meemo with code behind him\" \r\n      width=\"200\" height=\"200\"\r\n  />\r\n  <img \r\n      src=\"https://github.com/codemonkey3045/codemonkey3045.github.io/blob/master/meemo_and_i.jpeg?raw=true\"\r\n      alt=\"Meemo and I in California\" \r\n      width=\"200\" height=\"200\"\r\n  />\r\n  <img \r\n      src=\"https://github.com/codemonkey3045/codemonkey3045.github.io/blob/master/meemo4.png?raw=true\"\r\n      alt=\"Meemo pushing himself between me and my computer\" \r\n      width=\"200\" height=\"200\"\r\n  />\r\n</p>\r\n  \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Places I've lived (to write out as blog post or add to about me)\r\n* A rural village in northern Portugal -- and yes I totally speak Portuguese.\r\n* The Newark that's always on the news -- Hint: the state is known for its tomatoes\r\n* Baltimore - I wish I had explored more, but I was busy with school, work, and what I thought were required extra curriculars for med school. No regrets about any of my time with Circle K though.\r\n* NYC - Hmm, super hot summers and super duper cold winters. But I loved the 3am cheesecake options and everything else!\r\n   ...and now \r\n* San Francisco, California. It brings back a lot of childhood memories of growing up in Portugal. The weather is AMAZING here. Weather sort of beats all the sparkles NYC has.\r\n",
