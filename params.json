No regrets about any of my time with Circle K though.\r\n* NYC - Hmm, super hot summers and super duper cold winters. But I loved the 3am cheesecake options and everything else!\r\n\r\n   ...and now \r\n\r\n* San Francisco, California. It brings back a lot of childhood memories of growing up in Portugal. The weather is AMAZING here. Weather sort of beats all the sparkles NYC has.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
