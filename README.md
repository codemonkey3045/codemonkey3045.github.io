# A mini bit about me 
I am a software engineer with  experience developing web apps in Javascript and deploying and handling operations on Amazon Web Services (AWS).  I work on a variety of coding projects, mentor newer developers, and provide oncall support as needed.

Below is my most recent co-worker :)

### Places I've lived (to write out as blog post or add to about me)
* A rural village in northern Portugal -- and yes I totally speak Portuguese.
* The Newark that's always on the news -- Hint: the state is known for its tomatoes
* Baltimore - I wish I had explored more, but I was busy with school, work, and what I thought were required extra curriculars for med school. No regrets about any of my time with Circle K though.
* NYC - Hmm, super hot summers and super duper cold winters. But I loved the 3am cheesecake options and everything else!
   ...and now 
* San Francisco, California. It brings back a lot of childhood memories of growing up in Portugal. The weather is AMAZING here. Weather sort of beats all the sparkles NYC has.
